  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a PhD Candidate in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 
    Department, University of California at Berkeley, advised by Prof. Alberto 
    Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. Previously, I have interned at Texas Instruments 
    (Summer 2012), Cadence Design Systems (Summer 2014) and MSR (Summer 2017).<br>
    <br>
    I am broadly interested in Safe Learning, Control Theory, Formal Methods, 
    System Identification, Synthesis and Verification, Cyber Physical Systems 
    and Data Driven Design.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>System Identification from Data for Safe Learning</strong><br>
    We are exploring the problem of modeling unknown dynamics in hybrid systems 
    from historical and run time data while guaranteeing safety. We are 
    considering both supervised and unsupervised learning based on the system 
    domain. Due to the uncertainities in the unknown part of the system, we are 
    looking into probabilitic models such as Markov Chains and Neural Networks 
    and learnig specifications on the model in Probabilitic Signal Temporal 
    Logic (PrSTL) which can be used for synthesis and verification purposes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Diagnosis and Repair of Specifications for Controller Synthesis</strong><br>
    We diagnose failures expressed in Signal Temporal Logic in a reactive 
    control algorithm. Our tool, DiaRY, identifies the causes of infeasibility 
    in the specifications and provides minimal timing and predicate repairs to 
    make the controller synthesis problem feasible. This work was presented in 
    Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, 2016.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Requirement Engineering using Contracts</strong><br>
    We are currently working on building a tool which could help us reason with 
    contracts or specifications expressed in different mathematical formalisms 
    (such as Linear Temporal Logic, Signal Temporal Logic). The tool would help 
    the designer reason about the compatibility, consistency and realizability 
    of specifications.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Robust Online Monitoring of Signal Temporal Logic</strong><br>
    We developed an Online Monitor in C++ for testing systems whose 
    specifications are expressed in Signal Temproal Logic. The Online Monitor 
    saved up to 24% simulation time with minimal overhead. This work won the 
    best paper award at Runtime Verification, 2015.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Compositional Synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic Primitives</strong><br>
    We are developing a tool which takes as input a Linear Temporal Logic 
    specification and uses a structural mapping approach (similar to DAGON) to 
    map the specification to LTL primitives in a library. This approach is able 
    to handle specification more general than GR1 specifications and at the same
    time reduce the doubly exponential complexity of synthesis from LTL.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Maintenance of Components in Safety Critical Hybrid Systems</strong><br>
    We are looking at the problem of maintence of components in a Power System. 
    We first model the components using graphical models and identify its 
    acceptable behaviors. We then design monitors which tracks the behavior of 
    the components during its operation and identify which components need 
    maintenance ahead of time.
